# MkDocs Writing your docs

## Key takeaway
MkDocs describes source-relative Markdown links, generated output paths and heading anchors supplied by its Markdown extensions.

## Summary
This reference identifies the documented link interface used by the package. The extracted rules support the navigation profile; they do not establish that an untested application configuration behaves identically. The source remains external.


## Current inspection and use limit

Heading links, relative Markdown file links and YAML metadata documentation were inspected. No installed MkDocs website or custom theme was tested.


## Source identity
**Creator:** MkDocs. **Title:** Writing your docs. **Source:** [Official documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/). **Date:** undated; accessed 2026-10-07. **Inspected extent this release:** selected official HTML.

## Evidence lineage
Python-Markdown implementation lineage. MkDocs delegates heading generation to Python-Markdown; those two records are not independent engines.

## Source paths and output rewriting
Links to Markdown documents should use source-relative paths. MkDocs rewrites these for the generated site; section fragments are retained.

**Locator:** Linking to pages.

## Heading generation
MkDocs uses the Python-Markdown Table of Contents extension for generated heading identifiers. Nondefault extensions can change behavior.

**Locator:** Linking to headings.

## Homepage naming
README.md can serve as an index page when no competing index.md is present.

**Locator:** Index pages.

## Scope and nonclaims
The record does not certify a particular theme, plugin, custom slug function or local MkDocs installation. This package is documentation input, not a deployed site.

## Deeper knowledge
The external publication above gives complete documentation. [Package navigation guide](../NAVIGATION.md) explains the selected authoring profile and its limits.
