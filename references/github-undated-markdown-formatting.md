# GitHub Basic writing and formatting syntax

## Key takeaway
GitHub documents how headings become section links and how relative file links are resolved.

## Summary
This reference identifies the documented link interface used by the package. The extracted rules support the navigation profile; they do not establish that an untested application configuration behaves identically. The source remains external.


## Current inspection and use limit

Section links, duplicate headings, editing headings and relative links were inspected. Simple complete headings are the navigation basis; no universal Markdown fragment standard is inferred.


## Source identity
**Creator:** GitHub. **Title:** Basic writing and formatting syntax. **Source:** [Official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). **Date:** undated; accessed 2026-10-07. **Inspected extent this release:** selected official HTML.

## Evidence lineage
GitHub documentation. MkDocs delegates heading generation to Python-Markdown; those two records are not independent engines.

## Generated section links
The documented section-link algorithm lowercases letters, replaces spaces with hyphens, removes other punctuation and disambiguates repeated headings. A changed heading changes the generated target.

**Locator:** Section links.

## Relative file links
Relative paths are evaluated from the current file and may include a section anchor. Metadata IDs do not automatically create such anchors.

**Locator:** Relative links and Custom anchors.

## Deeper knowledge
The external publication above gives complete documentation. [Package navigation guide](../NAVIGATION.md) explains the selected authoring profile and its limits.
